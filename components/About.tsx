        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
          A Wilmington native, Anthony Hawkins has spent over ten years in the trenches of property and project
          management. From overseeing warehouse operations and supervising cleaning teams for a major real estate firm
          to hands-on experience in new construction final cleans, he has seen firsthand where other services fall
          short. As an OSHA 10 certified professional, Anthony brings industry-recognized safety expertise and standards
          to every project.

        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
          He founded Hawkins Cleaning Services with his wife on a simple principle: to provide the reliable,
          professional, and solution-oriented service he always wished for as a manager. It's a family business built on
          hard work, integrity, and a genuine desire to help other local businesses and builders succeed.
